Use this Neo4j query tool to explore relationships and patterns in complex data sets. Ideal for
scenarios requiring graph-based data analysis, such as network security analysis, fraud detection,
and recommendation systems.

Example Query Descriptions:

    1.Query to Find All IPs with Domain Associations:
    Retrieve all nodes representing IP addresses that have at least one associated domain. This query helps identify active IPs with domain links.
    Query Cypher: MATCH (n) WHERE n.ip IS NOT NULL AND n.domain_count > 0 RETURN n.ip, n.domain_count

    2.Query for Potentially Malicious IPs:
    Identify IP addresses flagged with a severity level and a confidence level in their threat assessment. This query is essential for focusing on IPs that have been assessed, even if they are not confirmed as malicious.
    Query Cypher: MATCH (n) WHERE n.severity IS NOT NULL AND n.confidence_level IS NOT NULL RETURN n.ip, n.severity, n.confidence_level

    3.Query to List All IPs with Zero Domain Associations:
    Fetch all IP nodes that currently have no associated domains. This query can help in identifying isolated IPs in the network.
    Query Cypher: MATCH (n) WHERE n.ip IS NOT NULL AND n.domain_count = 0 RETURN n.ip

    4.Query for Nodes with Specific Attributes:
    Retrieve nodes that contain a specific attribute, such as a name or an IP address, to understand the entity structure within the graph.
    Query Cypher: MATCH (n) WHERE n.name IS NOT NULL OR n.ip IS NOT NULL RETURN n

    5.Query for Detailed IP Analysis:
    Analyze IP nodes with additional details such as severity, confidence level, and domain associations to prioritize security responses.
    Query Cypher: MATCH (n) WHERE n.ip IS NOT NULL AND (n.severity IS NOT NULL OR n.domain_count IS NOT NULL) RETURN n.ip, n.severity, n.confidence_level, n.domain_count LIMIT 20

These prompts guide the agent to construct and execute specific Neo4j queries that align with the structure and needs of the database. By using these examples, the intelligent agent can generate accurate and contextually appropriate queries for various analysis scenarios.
